            For our Scale and Distortion Game, we chose to utilize scale as our main theme to focus with a little bit of distortion on 
        as a side theme. Our game's main mechanic focuses on scaling the size of Alice by taking drugs so that she can access certain 
        parts of the map to solve the puzzle and escape the facility. Alice can shrink smaller to enter vents or grow bigger to move 
        heavier boxes. The distortion theme is featured as taking too many drugs will cause Alice to hallucinate, allowing her to see 
        mythical creatures and phenomenons as well as hints to passing each level.
